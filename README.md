hello! i am an eighteen year-old kid from Brazil who codes for a living. i'm not the best at it but i can work my way round a few technologies, such as Java, JS and MySql. always willing to learn new stuff!
i am also a music and cinema enthusiast! my favourite band is Radiohead and my favourite movie is Spirited Away.
